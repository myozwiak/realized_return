Replication package for the paper, "Calculating the realized investment returns of U.S. electric utilities" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jup.2023.101684).

Notes:
 - Download the zip folder to obtain the code, data and figures.
 - Raw Form-1 data is obtained from fern.gov, and converted to a text file for each sheet and year: https://www.ferc.gov/general-information-0/electric-industry-forms/form-1-1-f-3-q-electric-historical-vfp-data
 - All other data is sourced in code within the comments
 - The analysis is executed in R. Open the .RProject file to have the relative references work.
 - Please see the file "_main.R" for the sequence and purpose of each script.
 - Data is divided into "raw" and "created" (populated when scripts are run).
 - All figures and tables are saved to the "output" folder.

P.S. I highly recommend https://catalyst.coop/ for accessing Form-1 data in a sustainable way. I did not know about this group when I wrote this paper, but it can be a great resource if you plan on working with Form-1 data!
